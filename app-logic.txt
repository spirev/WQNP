This a brief note to explain how files interact with each other <3
( I will obviously speak about /js folder )
_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_

four different types of files handle the logic of the game :

1 - canvas-core-rendering.js
2 - game-logic.js
3 - ( folder ) entities-layout
4 - ( folder ) entities-state

index.html call the file 'canvas-core-rendering.js' who's in charge of calling all other files and most importantly create a new instance of canvas class to start displaying something.

canvas-core-rendering main funcionalities are :
    - call all other files
    - instantiate a new canvas
    - resize game window
    - render the game
    
game-logic.js main functionalities are :
    - define states of the game
    - instantiate entities on said state
    - ... ?
    
entities-layout files define classes for pretty much every entitie of the game.
( layout also exists for out of game classes such as canvas, menu, ... )

entities-state files are a container of the current state of said entities at current time of game.
Exemple, three goblins ennemies have been instantiated then the file called goblin-state should have three goblin classes stored in it.
( same thing apply for static-entities such as wall, block, ground, ... )
Files named entites-state.js and static-entities-state.js ( at root of these folder ) are just parent container containing every static entites states or every static entities states.

summary :

canvas-core-rendering -> game-logic -> static-entities-state / entites-state -> x-state -> layout 

that's it !
